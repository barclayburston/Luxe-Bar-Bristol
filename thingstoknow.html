                        <br>
                        We highly recommend clients do a full body exfoliation 24 hours before their tanning appointment. On the day please avoid using any oily products and wear loose clothing when coming for your treatment.
                        <br><br>
                        <span>Patch Tests</span>
                        <br>
                        We require patch tests to be carried out up to 24 hrs before some of our treatments that involve tint or products near the eye. Patch testing is required for eyebrow/eyelash tint, HD brows, eyelash extensions and Lash Lifts.

                        <span>Bookings, Cancellations and Changes</span>
                        <br>
                        The following terms apply to all appointments. At least 24 hours notice is requested if you need to cancel or change your appointment; otherwise the late cancellation costs as laid out below will be charged. Cancellation or change of treatment times within 24 hours of your booking will incur a charge of 100% of the full treatment value or full payment for treatments if under Â£10. As we are unable to judge reasons for change, cancellation or non-arrival, clients are reminded that no exceptions to the above conditions will be made and that any booking made with the salon (verbal or written) forms a legally binding contract regarding this.

                        <span>Children</span>
                        <br>
                        We respectfully ask that adults do not bring children under the age of 14 into the salon for health and safety reasons and to keep noise levels to a minimum.

                        <span>Payment</span>

                        For our amazing pedicures we recommend bringing some open toe shoes or flip flops with you to your appointment. After your appointment you can relax in our waiting area with a refreshment while your toes dry

                        <span>Gift Vouchers</span>
                        <br>
                        Vouchers can be bought in-store or by phone. They can be for any value or treatment and are a great way to treat a friend or loved one.

                        <span>Late Arrival For Treatments</span>
                        <br>
                        Please note that if clients arrive late for an appointment the treatment time will be shortened to ensure subsequent treatments run on time. The full price of the treatment will be charged.
                        <br><br>
                        <span>Client Confidentiality</span>
                        <br>
                        We take the issue of client confidentiality very seriously. All personal information and treatment details are kept securely and in confidence and will not be disclosed to any third party outside of the Luxe Bar business.
