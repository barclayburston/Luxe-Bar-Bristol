                            <li>Do not touch your skin, colour can transfer to your palms and can be difficult to remove</li>
                            <li>The first shower should be a rinse only, wait until the shower water runs clear</li>
                            <li>Use gentle body washes, bar soap can strip the skin therefore the tan as well</li>
                            <li>Moisturise the skin two times a day for longer lasting tan</li>
                            <li>USE SPF, a spray tan will NOT protect you from the sun</li>
                            <li>Around day 5, begin to exfoliate again, this will help with a even fading of colour</li>
                            <li>Completely exfoliate the tan off before getting your next spray tan</li>
