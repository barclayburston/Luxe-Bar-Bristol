                                Do not touch your skin, colour can transfer to your palms and can be difficult to remove
                                <br>
                                The first shower should be a rinse only, wait until the shower water runs clear

                                Use gentle body washes, bar soap can strip the skin therefore the tan as well
                                <br>
                                Moisturise the skin two times a day for longer lasting tan

                                USE SPF, a spray tan will NOT protect you from the sun
                                <br>
                                Around day 5, begin to exfoliate again, this will help with a even fading of colour
                                <br>
                                Completely exfoliate the tan off before getting your next spray tan

                                Do not get wet for the next 8-12 hours
                                <br>
                                Do not touch your skin, colour can transfer to your palms and can be difficult to remove
                                <br>
                                The first shower should be a rinse only, wait until the shower water runs clear
                                <br>
                                Use gentle body washes, bar soap can strip the skin therefore the tan as well
                                <br>
                                Moisturise the skin two times a day for longer lasting tan
                                <br>
                                USE SPF, a spray tan will NOT protect you from the sun
                                <br>
                                Around day 5, begin to exfoliate again, this will help with a even fading of colour
                                <br>
                                Completely exfoliate the tan off before getting your next spray tan

                                Avoid getting your lashes wet for at least 24 hours after your treatment

                                Avoid the use of a sauna, steam room, swimming pool and sunbeds until 48 hours after your treatment

                                Avoid going to the gym, hot yoga or any activities that will make you sweat for at least 24 hours after the treatment

                                Wash/Wipe your lashes daily after 24 hours, your eyelash artist will assist you and show you how to do this safely
                                <br>
                                Pulling, picking and rubbing your eyes will effect the retention of your lashes and could cause damage
