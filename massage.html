                <span>Indian Head Massage</span>
                <br><br>
                LUXE Bar offers a take on the ancient Indian Head massage treatment, by use of the traditional system of medicine ‘the science of life and longevity.’ It is based around the balance within the body, mind and spirit, and is said to promote a long life. Indian Head massages originally only focused on the head area, but are now extended to focus on the upper arms, neck and shoulders too.
                <br><br>
                Our Indian Head Massage has a variety of health benefits including increasing blood circulation, increasing lymphatic flow to the head which eliminates toxins and waste products, and stimulates the release of endorphins from the brain, relieving notions of anxiety, depression and emotional stress. The massage leaves you with a sense of clearer thinking and concentration and can benefit everyone with the treatment adaptable around your needs.
